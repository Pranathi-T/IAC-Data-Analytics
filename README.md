**Comprehensive Analysis of Student Interns**
**Project Overview**
Millions of students apply for internships and jobs every year, with resumes playing a crucial role in creating the first impression. Recruiters spend a maximum of 2-3 minutes reviewing a resume, with more than 70% getting rejected in the initial screening. In a competitive job market, it's essential to pay attention to details and invest time in preparing a quality resume.

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of student interns to gain insights into the relationship between their academic performance, event participation, career aspirations, and factors influencing their success. We have collected a dataset containing various attributes for each student.
